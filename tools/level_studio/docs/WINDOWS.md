# Windows executable and build

The Windows x64 download contains **Azurik Level Studio.exe**, a PyInstaller one-file, windowed application with Python, Pillow, pywebview and dependencies. Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime and .NET Framework are prerequisites. It opens a desktop window without an external browser or console.

The executable is unsigned. Its SHA-256 is in `windows/build.json` and `windows/SHA256SUMS.txt`; the release ZIP includes these files. Verify downloads against the checksum. Security software can quarantine unsigned applications; this project does not alter antivirus settings. Verify provenance before restoring it, or rebuild from source.

## Launch and data

In the repository: `windows/Azurik Level Studio.exe`, **Ouvrir Azurik Level Studio.bat**, **Launch Studio.cmd**, or **Launch.ps1**. The release ZIP places the executable at its root with a matching `.bat`.

Optional arguments: `--source "C:\Games\Azurik dump"`, `--port 8770`, `--debug`. Diagnostics are off by default. An existing Azurik server on that port is reused; an unrelated service produces a conflict message. Only a server started by this launcher is closed with the window.

Frozen builds read bundled files from PyInstaller's extraction directory and write data under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AzurikLevelStudio`. Logs include `logs/desktop-error.log` and `logs/frozen-server.log`. Source runs keep data beside the code. Imports and texture caches need additional disk space.

## Rebuild

On Windows x64 with Python 3.11+ available through `py -3`:

```powershell
& '.\Build Windows.ps1'
```

The script creates `.venv-desktop`, installs `requirements-build.txt`, compiles `desktop.spec`, copies the binary into `windows/` and records its checksum. Only application resources and dependencies are bundled, excluding game data and user projects. UPX is not used.

Manual build:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv-desktop
.\.venv-desktop\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-build.txt
.\.venv-desktop\Scripts\python.exe -m PyInstaller --noconfirm desktop.spec
```

Source development uses `requirements-desktop.txt` and `desktop.py`. Run `python -m pytest -q`; Node.js is required for frontend tests only.
